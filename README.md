# Portfolio 2.0

## Description

Tasked with making the same portfolio as last time but using Bootstrap this time around. It was much easier using bootcamp because you don't have to use the dreaded css as much when you are using Bootstrap.

### What was working for me and what wasn't

I got most of it down and working pretty easily the thing that had me stumped for the longest time was trying to figure out how to make the <figcaption>'s I used for the portfolio page to float on top of the image itself. 

After finally figuring out how to make them float on top of the image I spent the next hour trying to figure out why the length of them kept messing up until I felt dumb and just had to fix the padding on them because they had a random 15 padding automatically.

## Thanks

This is my first attempt at a legit readme file so hope that suffices for what this project is as of now.
